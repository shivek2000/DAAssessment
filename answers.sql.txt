question 1. 
Using SMALLINT for a seconds column is better because it saves space (just 2 bytes), and it works fine for the range of seconds (-32,768 to 32,767),
while INT is bulkier at 4 bytes and usually not needed for this job.

question 2.

Code:
SELECT c.id, c.name, cl.length_in_sec
FROM callingagent c
INNER JOIN callinglogs cl ON cl.caller_id = c.id
ORDER BY cl.length_in_sec DESC
LIMIT 1;

Answer:
Agent : Takalani Wood,
Longest call :3,629	


Question 3

SELECT callingagent.id AS "Caller ID", callingagent.name AS "Name", COALESCE(COUNT(callinglogs.caller_id), 0) AS "Call Count"
FROM callingagent
LEFT JOIN callinglogs ON callinglogs.caller_id = callingagent.id AND callinglogs.length_in_sec >= 1
GROUP BY callingagent.id, callingagent.name
ORDER BY callingagent.id;

question 4

code:
SELECT callingagent.location, AVG(callinglogs.length_in_sec) AS "Average Call Length"
FROM callingagent
LEFT JOIN callinglogs ON callinglogs.caller_id = callingagent.id AND callinglogs.length_in_sec >= 1
GROUP BY callingagent.location
ORDER BY "Average Call Length" DESC
LIMIT 1;

answer :
Location :JHB,
Hight Average call length :114.47	

question 5

code:
SELECT callingagent.name,callinglogs.start_timestamp,callinglogs.length_in_sec
FROM callingagent
LEFT JOIN callinglogs ON callinglogs.caller_id = callingagent.id 
order by start_timestamp asc
limit 1

answer
Agent :Hendrik Padayachee,
Date :2018-10-26 08:29,
